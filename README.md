## How the Code Works
- GPIO pins are configured as output  
- Required power-up delay is provided  
- LCD initialization commands are sent  
- Character and string data are written to the LCD  
- Display output is verified on hardware  

---

## Output
- Characters and strings are successfully displayed on the LCD.

---

## Tools Used
- Keil µVision (Compiler and Build)
- Flash Magic (Programming)
- Embedded C

---

## What I Learned
- GPIO configuration on LPC1768  
- LCD command vs data control  
- Pointer-based string handling in C  
- Multi-file embedded C programming  
- Debugging compiler and linker errors
